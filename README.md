TabLists
========

*A Firefox TabGroups/Panorama replacement*

**THIS IS VERY MUCH UNDER EARLY DEVELOPMENT**

Don't expect this to work yet. At all. But feel free to have a look around, I guess.

## Planned Features

* Create unlimited lists for your tabs
* Custom tab list titles
* Custom tab list background colors
* Automatically adds your open tabs to the current tab list
* Uses bookmarks as storage, so syncing to your other devices is handled by your browser
* Drag & drop to rearrange lists, tabs within lists, and even move tabs to other lists
* Click on a tab list item to load that tab list and go directly to that tab
