                    <h3>What is TabLists?</h3>
                    <p><b>TabLists</b> is a tool for organized people to manage their browser tabs.</p>
                    <p>TabLists was inspired by Firefox TabGroups/Panorama, a unique feature that will soon be removed. As a web developer, I used to rely heavily on TabGroups to organize my browsing sessions into groups pertaining to each project. With the announcement of its removal, I searched for a plugin that could replace it that was similar enough in functionality to not completely destroy my workflow, yet would hopefully handle the tabs in a more resource-friendly way. There were none.</p>
                    <h3>Why should I use TabLists? Aren't you just making bookmarks?</h3>
                    <p>Well, yes, basically. TabLists automatically keeps track of your tabs as you open and close them, saving them to bookmarks in the background. You can then quickly switch to another group of tabs, which will be loaded from those bookmarks. If you want to sync your TabLists across devices, let the browser do it for you, and TabLists will pick them up.</p>
                    <p>If you aren't convinced, or if you've got a suggestion that would make this more useful, please use the "Send Feedback" link on the Chrome Extension web store page.</p>
                    <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
                    <p>If you're familiar with the old TabGroups, there are enough similarities that you shouldn't have many problems. The largest difference is that these are lists, which means no messy, differently-sized boxes with website preview tiles. Simply click the TabLists button to open a popup window containing all of your TabLists, and click the title of the list to load those tabs with your last active tab restored. If you want to load a list with a specific tab loaded as active, just click on that tab title in the list instead.</p>
                    <h3>Who made TabLists?</h3>
                    <p><b>TabLists</b> was developed by <a href="http://coryhughart.com" target="_blank">Cory Hughart</a>, a.k.a. 'cr0ybot'.</p>
                    <h3>How can I support TabLists?</h3>
                    <p>I made this mainly for myself in order to deperately cling to a web browsing workflow that works well for me, but if you feel like it's helped you too and you want to show your support, you can donate some bitcoins!</p>
